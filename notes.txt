progressive method doesn't need glu ( we try without GLU )

1. you might need to try the best trained models with dropout inference

2. you might need to also train using dropout and if there is no difference, it is better

3. try two stream for the AFEW first. if it improved the performance then use it for other datasets too
but if only dropout improves the performance, you don't need to use two stream for others

4. try two stream only for stbln which is your method
